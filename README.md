# Preliminary Requisites
## Blockchain Platform:
1. Optimism Network: Utilize the Optimism Layer 2 network for its compatibility with Ethereum and support for smart contracts.
2. Token Standard: Use ERC-20 or ERC-721 token standards for tokenizing healthcare data.
3. Security and Scalability: Leverage the scalability and security benefits of Optimism's rollup technology.
## HL7 Standards Integration:
4. Data Standardization: Implement HL7 FHIR (Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources) or other HL7 standards to ensure interoperability and compatibility with other healthcare systems.
5. FHIR Libraries: Utilize FHIR libraries for data serialization, deserialization, and data mapping to adhere to HL7 standards.
6. API Support: Support APIs for HL7 FHIR to enable data exchange and integration with other healthcare systems.
## Smart Contracts:
7. Development Language: Write smart contracts in Solidity, the primary language supported by Ethereum and Optimism.
8. Testing Frameworks: Utilize testing frameworks like Hardhat or Truffle for development and testing.
9. Auditing Tools: Employ smart contract auditing tools to check for vulnerabilities and ensure data integrity.
## dApp Frontend:
10. Web Technologies: Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for frontend development.
11. Frontend Frameworks: Use modern JavaScript frameworks such as React, Vue.js, or Angular to build interactive and user-friendly interfaces.
12. Blockchain Libraries: Utilize blockchain libraries like ethers.js or Web3.js to interact with the Optimism network and smart contracts.
## Data Storage:
13. On-chain and Off-chain Storage: Use a combination of on-chain storage for metadata and tokenized data, and off-chain storage (e.g., IPFS or Filecoin) for sensitive healthcare data.
14. Data Encryption: Encrypt data both at rest and in transit for security and privacy.
## Identity and Access Management:
15. Authentication and Authorization: Implement secure identity management and access control mechanisms, potentially using OAuth or OpenID Connect.
16. Data Privacy: Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations such as HIPAA or GDPR.
## Account Abstraction:
17. Smart Contract Wallets: Implement account abstraction using smart contract wallets: ERC-4337 such as [Candide](https://www.candide.dev/) then interact with other Optimism products/services
18. User Onboarding: Simplify the onboarding process for users like clinical labs and hospitals by using account abstraction for easier and more flexible account management.
19. Multi-Sig Wallets: Use multi-signature wallets for organizations like hospitals to ensure secure and collaborative decision-making.
## User Interface Design:
20. Accessibility: Adhere to accessibility standards for a user-friendly experience for all users, including those with disabilities.
21. Intuitive Design: Focus on a clear, intuitive design to facilitate ease of use, especially for non-technical users.
## Monitoring and Maintenance:
21. Analytics: Integrate monitoring and analytics tools to assess dApp performance and user engagement.
22. Updates and Patches: Establish a process for updating and patching smart contracts and other software components safely.
## Legal and Compliance:
23. Regulation Adherence: Ensure compliance with healthcare regulations such as HIPAA or GDPR.
24. Tokenization Strategy: Develop a tokenization strategy with patient privacy and data ownership in mind.
